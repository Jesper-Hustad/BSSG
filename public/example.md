# A markdown page
This is a page generated from the markdown file `src/example.md`.  
The title `Markdown Example` came from the markdown header.  
This is also converted to the url, so this page is located at `/markdown-example`  

Because this is just markdown any previewer will work 

The rest of this page includes some examples of markdown features.
